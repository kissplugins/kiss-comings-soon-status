A WordPress plugin to add a "Coming Soon" post status. This allows you to show posts in archive/category pages to build anticipation, but prevents users from clicking through to the full post.

##Description  
This plugin introduces a new post status called "Coming Soon". It's designed for when you want to tease upcoming content on your website without publishing the full post or page yet.

When a post or page is set to "Coming Soon":

It will still appear in your post grids on category, archive, and landing pages.

The featured image and excerpt will display as normal, giving visitors a preview of the content.

The "Read More" link (or equivalent) will be automatically replaced with the text "Coming Soon".

The link will point to "#" instead of the actual post URL, preventing public access to the single post page until you are ready to publish it.

This is the perfect solution for building anticipation for new articles, products, or announcements while maintaining your site's layout and design.

##Installation  
Upload the entire plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory via FTP, or upload the zip file through the WordPress admin panel (Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin).

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

That's it! You can now use the "Coming Soon" status on your posts and pages.

##How to Use  
Go to edit or create a new Post or Page.

In the Status & visibility panel (in the block editor) or the Publish meta box (in the classic editor), click on the current status (e.g., "Draft" or "Published").

You will now see "Coming Soon" as an option in the dropdown list.

Select "Coming Soon" and click Update or Save Draft.

The post will now appear on your site's archive pages with the "Coming Soon" link. When you are ready to publish it fully, simply change the status to "Published".

##Settings  
A placeholder settings page has been created and can be accessed via:

Settings > Coming Soon Status in the WordPress admin menu.

The "Settings" link next to the plugin on the main Plugins listing page.
